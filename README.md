# Sudanese_Music_Dataset_SMD
Small audio Dataset of the Sudanese songs for Music Information Retrieval (MIR) purposes.

The repository has these files:
- 272 raw audio files (the orignal files were 136, 30 seconds were taken from the beginning and the early middle of each track, as the Sudanese song are long in duration and the composition of the notes and the modes might change throughout the song).
- Mid-level features extracted using mainly librosa and other audio processing libraries.

Challenges under resolve:

The dataset is not labelled as this is a challenge that we are I am working to solve now with the assistance of Sudanese music professionals. This repository has raw audio files that could be used for audio processing and understanding purposes, it's also valuable for research purposes in the ethnomusicology research field especially that path of exploring the folk music of the non-western and the least represented countries like Sudan.
