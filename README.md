# Sudanese_Music_Dataset_SMD

Small audio Dataset of the Sudanese songs for Music Information Retrieval (MIR) purposes.
I created this dataset for my masters research project where I'm creating a corpora for Sudanese Music through labelling and organizing the collections of the Sudanese songs using unsupervised machine learning techniques.

The repository has these files:
- 1262 raw audio files in a .wav format (the orignal files were 631, 30 seconds were taken from the beginning and the early middle of each track, as the Sudanese songs are long in duration and the composition of the music might change throughout the song).
- Higher-level features extracted using mainly SpotifyAPI, in a .csv file.

Challenges under resolve:

The dataset is not labelled yet as this is a challenge that I am working to solve now with the assistance of Sudanese music professionals. This repository has raw audio files that could be used for audio processing and understanding purposes, it's also valuable for research purposes in the ethnomusicology research field especially that path of exploring the folk music of the non-western and the least represented countries like Sudan.
