# Sudanese_Music_Dataset_Haqeeba

Small audio Dataset of the Sudanese songs for Music Information Retrieval (MIR) purposes.
I created this dataset, in collaboration with my co-supervisor and friend Mohamed Ali, for my masters research project where I'm trying to create a corpora for Sudanese Music through labelling and organizing the collections of the Sudanese songs in a structured way using unsupervised machine learning techniques.

The repository has these files:
- 1348 raw audio files in a .wav format (the orignal files were 674, 30 seconds were taken from the beginning and the early middle of each track, as most of the Sudanese songs are long in duration and the composition of the music might change throughout the song), as due to size limitations, the audio files are shared on a google drive link below.
- Higher-level features extracted using mainly SpotifyAPI, in a .csv file.
-Acapella version of the songs (only vocals)
-Karaoke version of the songs (only instrumental music)
-Full-duration original songs

Challenges under resolve:

The dataset has been organized using unsupervised clustering and was labelled into five categories according to their high-level features as follows:
1) Sentimental Danceable
2) Ambient Sway
3) Fast Upbeat Acoustic
4) Mello Upbeat Acoustic
5) Fast Festive Danceable
